disk size : 524 mb

intial menu : 1.create  2.mount  3.exit
create -> it creates new disks by taking name from user
mount -> it is used to perform file operations in a disk

to enter data for file content -> press "end" after giving data to file in new line
example:
this is data for file
line1
line2
end       < this is used to indicate the end of file>

I used structures and maps to store data temporarily and later i pushed the data into disk

I used counter to give file descriptors when i open file in read / write / append mode
